# Game ls20-016295f7601e Analysis

## Initial Frame Analysis
- 64x64 grid
- Win score: 8
- Main colors:
  - 4 (gray): Background (52%)
  - 3 (green): Main play area (42.6%)
  - 0 (black): Small regions (1.6%)
  - 5 (yellow): Small squares (1.1%)
  - 9 (red): Small blocks (1.6%)
  - 12 (purple): 8-pixel stripes
  - 15 (pink): Top pattern row
  - 8 (blue): Small 2x2 blocks in upper right

## Key Patterns
1. **Top row pattern (row 2)**: Alternating 15 and 4 values
2. **Large green region**: Rows 8-47, columns 8-47 (main play area)
3. **Objects in play area**:
   - Yellow (5) blocks
   - Red (9) pairs
   - Black (0) regions of varying sizes
   - Purple (12) horizontal stripes

## Action Results

### Action 1: RIGHT (type 2)
- **Result**: No changes detected
- **Hypothesis**: RIGHT doesn't affect any objects

### Action 2: LEFT (type 1)
- **Result**: 129 pixels changed
- **Changes**:
  1. Position (2,2): 15 → 3 (pink became green)
  2. Region (40-47, 40-47): 3 → 12 (green became purple)
  3. Region (48-55, 40-47): 12 → 3 (purple became green)
- **Hypothesis**: LEFT causes block swapping - purple and green blocks exchanged positions

### Action 3: UP (type 3)
- **Result**: TBD

## Working Theory
The game appears to involve moving or swapping colored blocks within the play area. LEFT action caused a swap between purple (12) and green (3) blocks. The goal might be to arrange blocks in a specific pattern to reach the win score of 8.

## Next Steps
1. Analyze UP action results
2. Test DOWN action
3. Look for pattern in how blocks move/swap
4. Try ENTER action to see if it has special behavior
5. Map out all moveable objects and their behaviors
